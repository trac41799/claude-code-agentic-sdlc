# asdlc-doctor — Setup Check

Read-only health check. Run it, show the output as-is, then fix what failed.

## Run

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/asdlc-doctor/scripts/doctor.sh"
```

It prints PASS/FAIL lines for:

- **Prerequisites** — `git`, `gh` (authenticated), `perl`, `node`/`npm`/`npx`, `rsync` —
  exactly what `/asdlc-project` runs (perl for placeholder substitution, node + rsync for
  the Next.js scaffold in step 9)
- **Repo context** — git remote + author email of the current directory
- **Project layout** — when run inside a scaffolded project: `FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md`,
  4 agents in `.claude/agents/`, 16 skills in `.claude/skills/`, no retired v2.4-era
  agents/skills lingering (writer/designer and their content pipeline — re-running
  `/asdlc-project` step 6 moves them to `.claude/retired-asdlc-<date>/`), `CLAUDE.md`
  delegation block present
- **Companion plugin** — whether a companion telemetry plugin is installed (Edge8-internal; not needed by outside users)

## Interpreting results

- Every FAIL line carries its own `fix:` — apply it directly when it's a
  read-only or local operation (installing a CLI, setting git config).
- `gh` not authenticated → tell the user to run `gh auth login` themselves
  (interactive; never run it for them).
- Missing agents / delegation block inside a project → offer to run `/asdlc-adopt`
  (installs/refreshes the team in an existing repo — the same content as
  `/asdlc-project` step 6).

## Hard rules

- This skill is read-only — it never writes files or settings.
- Telemetry consent, effort tracking, and v1-residue cleanup belong to the
  the companion telemetry skill (private Edge8 plugin) — if the user asks about
  tracking and that plugin isn't installed, say it's Edge8-internal and not
  part of this product.
