# Client setup — five prompts, in order

This guide is written for people who don't code — CEOs, sales, marketing. You paste
**prompts into Claude, in order**, and Claude does the work or tells you the exact thing
to click or paste. Each prompt ends by telling you which one to copy next, by name.

| # | Prompt | Where it runs | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Clean up** | Claude Code | Only if you've used Infinite Leverage before. Never used it? Skip. |
| 1 | **Get ready** | Any Claude — the website, the app, or Cowork | Everyone starts here. Ends with Claude Code installed and this computer signed in to GitHub. |
| 2 | **Set up your accounts** | Claude Code | Supabase and Vercel, click by click. |
| 3 | **Install** | Claude Code | Takes a minute. Claude does all of it. |
| 4 | **Create your project** | Claude Code | Your website and your four-person AI team, built in front of you. |

**Why Prompt 1 is different:** it runs in ordinary Claude — the chat you already have —
because at that point Claude Code isn't installed yet. In that chat, Claude can't touch
your computer, so it acts as a guide instead: it gives you one thing to copy and paste
at a time, and you tell it what you see. Every prompt after that runs in the **Claude
Code tab of the desktop app** (which Prompt 1 installs as its final step), where Claude
does the typing itself.

Every prompt follows the same rules: plain English, no jargon, one step at a time, and
nothing moves on until the current step is confirmed working.

---

## Prompt 1 — Get ready (run this in ordinary Claude — website, app, or Cowork)

The foundation: Chrome, a GitHub account, this computer signed in to GitHub, and Claude
Code installed. Claude guides; you click and paste.

```
Get my computer ready for Infinite Leverage. I'm not technical — you're my
guide. Plain English, one step at a time, and wait for me to say "done"
before moving to the next step.

Important: in this chat you can't touch my computer. So when something
needs typing, give me ONE thing to copy, tell me exactly where to paste
it, and tell me what should happen. When I paste back what I see, tell me
what it means — never just point at an error.

First, ask me: Mac or Windows? Then fit every step to my answer.

STEP 1 — Google Chrome
Ask if I have it. If not, send me to google.com/chrome and walk me through
installing it. Every sign-in below happens in Chrome, so my accounts stay
together in one place.

STEP 2 — GitHub account
Ask if I have one. If not, walk me through creating it at github.com in
Chrome, step by step, including the email verification. Either way, I
finish signed IN to github.com in Chrome — that matters later.

STEP 3 — Open the Terminal
Mac: press Cmd+Space, type Terminal, press Enter.
Windows: open the Start menu, type PowerShell, press Enter.
Tell me in one sentence what this window is — the place I'll paste the
next few commands — and reassure me: nothing we paste here can break my
computer.

STEP 4 — Install Homebrew (Mac only — Windows skips to step 5)
Homebrew is the app store for developer tools; later steps use it to
install things for me, so it has to exist first — and installing it needs
my password, which only I can type.
- Give me the one install command from brew.sh to paste into the Terminal.
- Warn me before I run it: it will ask for my computer password, nothing
  shows up while I type it — that's normal — and then it works for a few
  minutes. It also installs Apple's developer tools, which include git.
- When it finishes, it prints a short "Next steps" section with one or two
  commands to paste. Tell me to paste exactly those — they let the
  Terminal find Homebrew from now on.
It's done when   brew --version   pastes back a version number.

STEP 5 — Check git (the tool that tracks my project's history)
Mac: have me paste   git --version   — Homebrew's installer usually set it
up in step 4; if a popup offers to install developer tools instead, I
click Install and wait, then paste it again.
Windows: walk me through the installer from git-scm.com, default choices
all the way.
It's done when I paste back a line with a version number.

STEP 6 — Install the GitHub tool (gh)
Mac: have me paste   brew install gh
Windows: the .msi installer from cli.github.com, default choices.
It's done when   gh --version   pastes back a version number. (I may need
to close the Terminal and open a new one first — tell me if so.)

STEP 7 — Sign this computer in to GitHub
Have me paste   gh auth login   and stay with me through each question it
asks: GitHub.com, HTTPS, sign in with the web browser. The page it opens
is already signed in from step 2 — I just click Authorize.
It's done when   gh auth status   pastes back that I'm logged in.

STEP 8 — Install Claude Code (where everything else happens)
Send me to claude.ai/download, walk me through installing the Claude
desktop app and signing in with my Claude account, then have me open the
Claude Code tab. When it asks which folder to work in, my home folder or
Desktop is fine for now.

THEN tell me, exactly: "You're ready. From here on, everything happens in
the Claude Code tab you just opened — this chat's job is done. Go back to
the setup guide, copy the prompt called 2 - Set up your accounts, and
paste it THERE."

IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG
Plain English: what happened, what it means, what to try — one thing at a
time. Never leave me staring at an error.
```

---

## Prompt 2 — Set up your accounts (in Claude Code, from here on)

Two more free accounts — the database and the hosting. Claude checks the GitHub
connection from Prompt 1 first, then guides each sign-up click by click. All of it
happens in your browser.

```
Help me set up the remaining accounts my project needs. I'm not a
developer — be a patient guide. Plain English, one account at a time, and
don't move on until we've confirmed the current one works.

FIRST, a quick check: run  gh auth status  yourself. If this computer
isn't signed in to GitHub, stop and tell me: "Run the prompt called
1 - Get ready first — in the ordinary Claude app, not here." Then wait.

For each account, use this exact shape:
- one sentence on what it is and why my project needs it
- numbered steps: exactly where to go and what to click (I use Chrome,
  and I'm already signed in to GitHub there)
- what to type into any field that isn't obvious
- then confirm it worked — ask me what I see on screen

Go in this order:

1. Supabase — my project's database and its sign-in system.
   - Walk me through supabase.com — "sign in with GitHub" is one click.
     Then create ONE new project: tell me exactly what to click and what
     to name things.
   - Tell me to save the database password it shows me somewhere safe. We
     come back for the project's keys later — today it just needs to
     exist.
2. Vercel — puts my website on the internet.
   - Walk me through vercel.com — "sign up with GitHub" is one button, and
     that's all we need today.
After each account, show me a short tick-list of what's done and what's
next. When everything is done, tell me, exactly: "Accounts ready. Next: go
back to the setup guide and copy the prompt called 3 - Install. Paste it
right here."
Then stop and wait.

IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG
Tell me what happened in plain English and what to try — never just show
me an error.
```

---

## Prompt 3 — Install

The shortest one. Claude installs Infinite Leverage, checks everything is healthy, and
tells you what to paste next. If it spots the old version 1 on the machine, it sends you
to Prompt 0 first; if the computer isn't signed in to GitHub, back to Prompt 1.

```
Please install Infinite Leverage for me.

I'm not a developer. Plain English only — no jargon, no raw output. Tell me
what's happening in one sentence as you go, and only ask me something if
you truly need me.

1. First, a quick silent check: look for leftovers of the old version 1 —
   things like ~/.claude/.infiniteleverage-version, an il_telemetry folder
   inside ~/.claude/hooks, or files like product-manager.md and
   web-publisher.md inside ~/.claude/agents. If you find any, change
   nothing and tell me: "You have an older version on this computer. Go
   back to the setup guide and copy the prompt called 0 - Clean up, and
   paste it right here." Then stop.
2. Confirm this computer is signed in to GitHub (gh auth status). If it
   isn't, or if git or the GitHub tool is missing, don't fix it here —
   tell me: "Run the prompt called 1 - Get ready first — in the ordinary
   Claude app, not here." Then stop.
3. Check the remaining tools: Node, rsync, perl. If something's missing,
   install it with Homebrew (set up back in the Get ready prompt; on
   Windows use winget) — ask me once with a one-line reason, then handle
   it.
4. Install the plugin:
     claude plugin marketplace add talentedgeai/infinite-leverage
     claude plugin install infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage
   If it says the plugin is already installed, update it instead:
     claude plugin update infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage
5. Run /il-doctor. If everything passes, just say "all checks passed."
6. Then tell me, exactly: "Installed. Next: go back to the setup guide and
   copy the prompt called 4 - Create your project. Paste it right here."
Then stop and wait.

IF YOU GET STUCK
Stop and tell me in plain English what you need. Don't guess, and don't
tell me it worked if it didn't.
```

---

## Prompt 4 — Create your project

The build. Fill in the two highlighted lines (and describe your business in a sentence
or two), paste it, and Claude scaffolds the project, connects your accounts one key at a
time, and finishes by telling you the first three things to try.

```
Create my first Infinite Leverage project. I'm not a developer — plain
English only, no jargon, no raw output. One question at a time. Never ask
me to edit a file; you make the changes and tell me what you did.

1. Run /il-project to build my project:
   - Call it: <PROJECT NAME>
   - Folder name: <project-name-with-dashes>
   <Describe your business in a few sentences — what it does, who it's for,
   what you want built first. Mention a website you like the look of if you
   have one. Delete this line to answer questions later instead.>
   While it runs, keep me posted with one plain sentence per stage — no
   command output.
2. Then connect the accounts I made earlier, one key at a time:
   - Tell me exactly where to click to find each key (I already have the
     accounts), I'll paste the value to you, and you put it in the right
     file.
   - After that, confirm to me that the file holding my keys stays private
     on my computer and can never end up on GitHub.
3. Check the project builds. If something fails, fix it yourself if you
   can; otherwise explain in plain English what you need from me.
4. Ask me: "Want your project on GitHub now? It stays private, and it's
   how your site goes live later." Only do it if I say yes.
5. When everything's done, tell me in plain English:
   - what you built and where it lives on my computer
   - the three things I should try first, as things I can paste — starting
     with:  @product-manager let's plan the first feature
Then stop and wait.

IF YOU GET STUCK
Stop and tell me in plain English. Don't guess, and don't tell me
something worked when it didn't.
```

---

## Prompt 0 — Clean up (only if you've used Infinite Leverage before)

The old version 1 installed itself into a shared folder on your computer. Version 2
doesn't. This prompt removes the old version's leftovers — and only those. Run it in
Claude Code.

```
I think I have an old version of Infinite Leverage on my computer. Please
clean it up for me and get me onto the current version.

I'm not a developer. Talk to me in plain, friendly English — no technical
terms, no file paths, no raw output. And I don't want to approve every
little step: for anything on the old-version lists below, just do it.

FIRST, TELL ME THE PLAN — THREE SENTENCES, TOPS
Have a quiet look around first (change nothing yet), then tell me simply:
- whether you found leftovers from the old version, or not
- what you're going to do about it, in one plain sentence — something like
  "I'll remove the old version's files and one leftover setting, then get
  you onto the current version."
- that nothing of mine will be touched
Then get on with it. Don't list files at me, and don't wait for a yes.

WHAT COUNTS AS THE OLD VERSION
(This list is for you — never read it back to me.)

- ~/.claude/agents/ containing any of: designer.md, developer.md, devops.md,
  email-marketer.md, product-manager.md, qa.md, web-publisher.md, writer.md
- ~/.claude/hooks/ containing any of: pre-bash, prompt-submit, session-start,
  usage-context.py, update-project-status-usage.py, or an il_telemetry folder
- ~/.claude/.infiniteleverage-version
- ~/.claude/skills/ containing anything whose name starts with
  infiniteleverage-, pm-, dev-, devops-, qa-, writer-, designer-,
  web-publisher-, email-marketer-, scaffold-, or speckit- ... or is exactly
  one of: pm, dev, devops, qa, writer, designer, web-publisher,
  email-marketer, marketing-strategist, plan-protocol, github-flow,
  global-caveman, seo-audit, session-ingest, use-dev-team,
  use-marketing-team, create-agent, create-local-routine,
  create-local-task, create-remote-routine
- In ~/.claude/settings.json and ~/.claude/settings.local.json:
    * a permission entry of exactly  Bash(*)
    * "defaultMode": "acceptEdits"
    * any hook pointing at ~/.claude/hooks/pre-bash, prompt-submit,
      session-start, session-telemetry-*, or telemetry-privacy-guard

WHAT TO DO — QUIETLY, WITHOUT ASKING ME STEP BY STEP
1. Fix the settings: make dated backup copies of both settings files next
   to the originals, then remove only the old-version entries listed above.
   Change nothing else in those files. Don't show me the edits — just do it.
2. Remove the old files: move everything matching the lists above into one
   folder, ~/.claude/il-v1-archive-<today>. When you talk to me, call this
   "removed" — the folder is just a safety net, and you'll mention it once
   at the end.
3. If something matches an old-version name but looks like I changed it
   myself, leave it where it is and note it for the summary. Don't
   interrupt me about it.
4. Get me onto the current version:
     claude plugin marketplace add talentedgeai/infinite-leverage
     claude plugin install infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage
   If it says the plugin is already installed, update it instead:
     claude plugin update infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage
5. Run /il-doctor. If everything passes, just tell me "all checks passed."
   If something fails, tell me what it means in plain English and what you
   need from me — one thing at a time.

THE ONE RULE THAT NEVER BENDS
Anything in ~/.claude/ that is not on the lists above is MINE — my own
settings, my own skills, other tools I use. Leave all of it completely
alone. If you're not sure whether something is old Infinite Leverage or
mine, treat it as mine. That is the one thing worth stopping to ask me
about. Everything else, just handle.

WHEN YOU'RE DONE
Give me a short, friendly summary — three or four sentences, no jargon:
- what you cleaned up, or "your machine was already clean"
- that everything of yours was untouched, and a backup folder exists in
  case anything is ever needed back
- that you're now on the current version and all checks passed
Then my next step, worded like this: "Go back to the setup guide and copy
the prompt called 4 - Create your project — your accounts and sign-ins
from before still work. If you're on a new computer or no longer have
them, start with 1 - Get ready instead. Paste it right here in this chat —
or in a new one, both work."
Then stop and wait. Don't start setting up a project on your own.

IF YOU GET STUCK
Stop and tell me in plain English. Don't guess, don't remove anything extra
to get past an error, and don't tell me it worked if it didn't.
```

---

## Your team, once it's built

Four AI teammates live inside your project. Talk to them like colleagues — plain
English. Name one directly with `@`, or just describe what you want and the right one
picks it up.

| Teammate | What to ask them |
|---|---|
| **product-manager** | "what should we build next", plans, specs, "where are we" |
| **developer** | building features, fixing bugs, putting posts on the site |
| **qa** | "check this works", testing, sorting out bug reports |
| **devops** | "is the site up", deployments, rolling back a bad release |

House rules they all follow, so you don't have to police them: nothing is saved to the
project history unless you ask, and nothing goes live without a review step.

## What the commands actually do

You never need to memorise these — the prompts run them, or hand them to you ready to
paste. This table exists so none of it feels like magic.

| Command | In plain English |
|---|---|
| `git --version` | Asks git to introduce itself. On a Mac, the first time also offers to install it. |
| the install command from **brew.sh** | Installs Homebrew, the app store for developer tools. Asks for your password once — nothing shows while you type it, that's normal. |
| `brew install gh` | Uses Homebrew to install the GitHub tool. |
| `gh auth login` | Signs this computer in to your GitHub account — it opens your browser to prove it's really you. |
| `gh auth status` | Asks: is this computer signed in to GitHub? |
| `claude plugin marketplace add talentedgeai/infinite-leverage` | Tells Claude Code where Infinite Leverage lives. Run once, ever. |
| `claude plugin install infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage` | Installs Infinite Leverage. |
| `claude plugin update infiniteleverage@infiniteleverage` | Gets the newest version, if it's already installed. |
| `/il-doctor` | A health check. Says what's missing or out of date, and how to fix it. |
| `/il-project` | Builds a new project: the folder, the website, and your four AI teammates. |
| `/il-adopt` | Adds the four AI teammates to a project you already have. Doesn't touch your code. |
| `@product-manager …` | Talks to one teammate directly. Works with any of the four names. |
| `npm run build` | Test-assembles the website to prove nothing is broken. Claude runs it for you. |

## If something looks wrong

Paste this into Claude Code, any time:

```
Something's not working with my Infinite Leverage setup. Run /il-doctor,
tell me what's wrong in plain English, fix what you can yourself, and walk
me through anything that needs me — one step at a time.
```

The most common causes, for the curious:

| What you see | What it usually means |
|---|---|
| The teammates don't respond | They live inside each project — make sure you opened the project folder in Claude Code. |
| Something about GitHub sign-in | Run the GitHub steps of Prompt 1 again — signing in is the one thing only you can do. |
| The site won't build after setup | A key is missing or mistyped — Prompt 4's key step, run again, fixes it. |
